Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.
It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a
DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests. This
package is for Jasmine **version 2.0.0**.

To install through Package Control, search for **Jasmine**. If you
still don't have Package Control in Sublime Text, go get it. If you insist to
not install it, you can download the package and put it manually inside your
Pacakages directory. It should work but will not update automatically.
